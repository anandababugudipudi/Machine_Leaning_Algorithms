#                             Guess The Word Game                                 #
# =============================================================================== #
# When the user plays WordGuess, the computer first selects a secret word at      #
# random from a list which was obtained from a txt file. The program then prints  #
# out a row of dashesâ€”one for each letter in the secret word and asks the user to #
# guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is   #
# redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions,   #
# along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does  #
# not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user   #
# keeps guessing letters until either:                                            #
#       (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or         #
#       (2) the user has made ten incorrect guesses.                              #
#                                                                                 #
